cryptlib
--------

This file contains the usage terms for cryptlib.  The full details of cryptlib
usage are provided on the cryptlib home page; although this file and the
information on the web page should be identical, in case of any dispute the
web page takes precedence.  This file is included because some distributions
require the presence of a COPYING file.

cryptlib is distributed under a dual license that allows free, open-source use
under a GPL-compatible license and closed-source use under a standard
commercial license.  The GPL-compatible license (a.k.a. the Sleepycat license)
is given below.  Further details on this license are available from the
cryptlib home page.

  Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without

  1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this
     list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

  2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
     this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation
     and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

  3. Redistributions in any form must be accompanied by information on how to
     obtain complete source code for the cryptlib software and any accompanying
     software that uses the cryptlib software.  The source code must either be
     included in the distribution or be available for no more than the cost of
     distribution, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable
     conditions.  For an executable file, complete source code means the source
     code for all modules it contains or uses.  It does not include source code
     for modules or files that typically accompany the major components of the
     operating system on which the executable file runs.  Note that decoupling
     the software from the user, for example by running in a SaaS configuration,
     does not exempt you from these requirements.

If you're unable to comply with the above license then the following,
alternate usage conditions apply:

  Any large-scale commercial use of cryptlib requires a license.  "Large-scale
  commercial use" means any revenue-generating purpose such as use for
  company-internal purposes, or use of cryptlib in an application or product,
  with a total gross revenue of over US$5,000.  This allows cryptlib to be
  used in freeware and shareware applications, for evaluation and research
  purposes, and for non-revenue-generating or personal use without charge.  In
  addition the author reserves the right to grant free licenses for commercial
  use in special cases (for example where there is a general benefit to the
  public), contact the author for details if you think you qualify.
