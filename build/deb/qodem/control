Description: friendly ncurses-based Unicode-aware communications package
 Qodem is an open-source re-implementation of the Qmodem(tm)
 DOS shareware communications package, updated for more modern uses.
 Major features include:
 .
    * Unicode display: translation of CP437 (PC VGA), VT100 DEC
      Special Graphics characters, VT220 National Replacement
      Character sets, ATASCII, etc., to Unicode
 .
    * Terminal interface conveniences: scrollback buffer, capture
      file, screen dump, dialing directory, keyboard macros, script
      support
 .
    * Connection methods: serial, local shell, command line, telnet,
      ssh, rlogin, raw socket
 .
    * Emulations: ANSI.SYS (including "ANSI music"), Avatar, VT52,
      VT100/102, VT220, Linux, XTerm, PETSCII (Commodore), and ATASCII
      (Atari)
 .
    * Transfer protocols: Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem, and Kermit
 .
    * External script support.  Any program that reads stdin and
      writes to stdout and stderr can be run as a script.
 .
    * Host mode that provides a micro-BBS with messages, files, and
      sysop chat.
 .
 This version is built for text consoles using ncurses.
